# A minimalistic markdown driven blog

## Powered by Typescript, Vitejs and Preact

This is my ideal version of a minimal markdown blog. I write new blogs in the form of a markdown, save them in `./src/markdown/blogs` and they just get published.

## Install

Just run

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Demo

My personal webpage is powered by a version of this [albelfio.com](https://albelfio.com) where I have added Tailwind.
